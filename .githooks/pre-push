// alternate workflow idea
// break off into separate branch to merge

// there's no real pre-push hook, so need to alias `git push` to run this file if $(pwd) contains `wordcamp.test`


// when pushing to production branch, automatically run this

// also be able to run it manually when another branch is ready for review

// reuse pre-commit stuff somehow?
	// maybe call that file w/ $CHANGED_FILES supplied via cli argument
// but add prettier & eslint
