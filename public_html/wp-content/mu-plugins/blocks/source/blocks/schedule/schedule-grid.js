/*
 * todo-grid
 *
 *
 * wait until https://github.com/WordPress/wordcamp.org/pull/356 is merged
 *  incorporate any long-term changes from it
 *
 * diff against other blocks for consistency
 * php/js lint everything
 *      if not going to use prettier, then need to manually review all files in this block, and restore better formatting.
 *
 * when clicking on block after reload, it jumpscrolls to the top of the block, and have to scroll back down to re-click on the lower part of the block you wanted to inspect
 *      maybe a gutenberg thing? see if happens w/ other blocks
 *      https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/20111
 *
 * test under ie11 - should just see mobile/fallback schedule
 *
 * test other camps:
 *      2009.newyork - 8 tracks, prob same as 2012.nyc
 *      2012.nyc - 15 tracks, probably don't need to support, just fall back to mobile view
 *      2019.us also has 6 tracks (3 session, 3 workshop)
 *
 *      https://2013.sf.wordcamp.org/wp-admin/post.php?post=1404690&action=edit
 *          mostly done
 *          if want to be exact, can set proper break times, etc, then compare to shortcode, but looks good enough
 *
 *      https://2014.seattle.wordcamp.org/wp-admin/post.php?post=915536&action=edit
 *          content overflows, e.g. opening remakrs. time column is really small, should have a min-width or something there
 *              maybe need some kind of thing where it falls back to mobile view w/ 4+ tracks, or do something where set different media query breakpoints based on # of tracks
 *                  yeah that sounds better
 *          28th 9am "zero hour" in the shortcode it shows in ballroom and 250, but also spans into workshop which it shouldn't
 *              lisa's basics sessions should be there but it's not
 *              seems like that's a bug w/ the shortcode, and the block is doing it correctly
 *              verify
 *
 *      https://2016.kansascity.wordcamp.org/wp-admin/post.php?post=2349&action=edit
 *          front end
 *              11th overflows into sidebar b/c of too many tracks
 *              is there a graceful media query kind of solution to that, so it'll switch to mobile view if there isn't enough room for grid view?
 *
 *          back end mostly done, only minor things left
 *
 *          overlap warnings cover title so can't open link to fix
 *              partially fixed, but interrelated with another issue that's causing the remaining problem?
 *              sessions 771 and 804 are duplicates, both in town square, but 1 also spans into brookside. mistake on their end, 804 should be deleted.
 *
 *           "community support" isn't assigned to any track, so block is creating implicit 5th track for it.
 *               shortcode just doesn't display the session at all (but it does display the track description, which matches the session title)
 *               block behavior is probably "correct"
 *               5 tracks causes horizontal scrolling, but that's just a side-effect of incorrect data-entry in this case.
 *                  still need to handle that when there are 5 legit tracks though
 *
 *          "doors open" on 12th - why notice floated right instead of blocked below?
 *
 *      https://2017.us.wordcamp.org/wp-admin/post.php?post=12186&action=edit
 *          front end
 *              switches to mobile view at 1142px, but still plenty of room for grid view at that width
 *
 *
 *      https://2018.montreal.wordcamp.org/wp-admin/post.php?post=3361&action=edit
 *          lots spanning multiple tracks, would have to change the track slugs to get them working, not worth distorting production data.
 *          lots of tracks showing up, should only be 3?
 *              looks right if you choose the specific tracks that are shown by the shortcode
 *          "more than words" assigned to Business and Canada, but shortcode only shows it in Canada, doesn't show business at all.
 *              block is behaving correctly, but shortcode is (known?) bug?
 *          might be difficult to suss out any potential issues b/c so many superficlous track assignments, probably don't bother
 *
 *      wcus
 *
 *      http://2019.europe.wordcamp.org/schedule - matt's session spans some but not all tracks - should be fine b/c alphabetical
 *      boston
 *
 *      miami
 *      tokyo
 *      any others? will still need beta testing
 *      todo delete those once done testing, but first make sure that any conditions found there are added to test/sample-sessions.xml
 *
 *      maybe automate setting duration more intelligently, like look at all sessions in a track, figure out start time of next session, and set duration based on that?
 *          probably still have to manually fix some, but not as much
 *          worth the time to write it?
 *
 * horizontal scrolling when block has align `full` set
 *
 * add support for wc-post-type "favorite" functionality, maybe iterate on it while have the opportunity, but maybe not high priority
 *
 * `git diff production` and check each line to make sure it's clean
 *
 * once this is ready for final review, maybe start a fresh PR b/c #104 is already cluttered and long and outdated
 *      reference the original for historical tracking
 *
 * remove _tmp_dateI18n if https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/18982 is merged, but make sure we're running that version before deploy
